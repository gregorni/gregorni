Hi, my name is gregorni.

I'm a teenage tech enthusiast from Germany and am mostly interested in Linux and Open Source.
I do a lot of translating and know some Rust and Python, and a lot of Bash.
I'm not terribly good at programming yet, so I'm looking to gain some experience by contributing to various projects.

You can also find me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gregorni), where I write about Linux and Tech, and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gregorni), where I host my own projects, contribute and generally prefer to work.
